# Geo Local

GeoLocal is a game meant to challenge your knowledge of your local city, inspired by [geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). GoLocal differs from GeoGuessr by focusing on smaller localities rather than the entire globe. The frontend is written in Angular and the backend is written in .NET, and everything is hosted on Azure App Services.

# Running the App Locally

Run the api via `cd ./Backend` and `dotnet run`

Run the app via `cd ./Frontend`, `npm install`, and `npm start`
